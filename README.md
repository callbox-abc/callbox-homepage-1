# Callbox Homepage — V1 "Signal"

A homepage mockup for Callbox (B2B lead generation agency), built with
React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + lucide-react.

Design direction: dark, confident hero with an orbiting-icon illustration
around a central Callbox mark; bold sans-serif type; light sections
bookended by dark hero/CTA bands.

All copy, stats and logos are **sample content** for layout review only.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens at http://localhost:5173

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview   # sanity-check the production build locally
```

Output goes to `dist/`.

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this folder to its own GitHub repository.
2. In Vercel: **New Project → Import** the repo.
3. Vercel auto-detects the Vite framework preset (`vite build`, output `dist`).
   A `vercel.json` is included as a fallback in case auto-detection is off.
4. Deploy. No environment variables are required.
